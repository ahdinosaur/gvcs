Lumen Global Value Compass is an unbiased, web-based investment system developed over the past 20 years by Lumen’s global investment team.  This proprietary model allows a direct comparison of value and risk across regions, countries, sectors and asset classes, using the same comparable metric, i.e. in essence calculating the IRR for each component of the capital structure implied by the market (Cost of equity, Cost of Capital, YTM and/or Interest Rates, all the way down to cash).

This is the most objective approach as it allows us to measure implied value and risk in absolute terms instead of as an “excess return or spread” relative to some arbitrary measures or benchmarks, e.g. risk-free rates. It also allows us to measure value and therefore risk starting from the most basic and riskiest form of capital, i.e. equity.  

Using the same proprietary system, we then are able to “extract” with reverse engineering, growth, profitability and risk for each asset class across regions (Advanced and Emerging), countries, sectors, all the way to individual names. Our final task is then to assess the assumptions implied by the market against realistic scenarios, measure their probability and, ultimately, determine potential performance and risk.
